# Hi there! I'm Carles! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¼ I'm a game designer and developer, as well as a bachelor in [Video Game Design and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/grau-videojocs-bcn/) at [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/) - [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en). I'm currently working as a game designer at [Starloop Studios](https://starloopstudios.com/) ðŸš€.

ðŸŽ® Regarding my projects, I'm specially proud of the video game triad my teammates and I pulled off during college: [Andro Dunos](https://github.com/ch0m5/Project_1), [Order 227: Not a Step Back](https://github.com/ChillChiliStudio/Order227), and [The Witcher: Ties of Destiny](https://github.com/Broken-Gem-Studio/The-Witcher-Ties-of-Destiny). Additionally, I made an AI-focused project called [Mutiny!](https://ch0m5.github.io/Mutiny/) as well as my own 3D OpenGL engine: [GATE](https://github.com/DocDonkeys/GATE_Engine), all with my awesome pal [DÃ­dac](https://github.com/DidacRomero), who I shared many of my hardships with. I think both turned out pretty sweet given their respective goals! Feel free to check them out!

âš¡ **Fun Fact**: GATE comes from GarrigÃ³-Approved Template Engine (GarrigÃ³ being our teacher at the time), as a joke for how our engine was going to be worthy of his expectations, and seeing how he selected it as the overall best of the class, it actually was! ðŸ˜‚

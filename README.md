I'm currently working as a Game Designer at [Starloop Studios](https://starloopstudios.com/) ðŸš€.

ðŸŽ“ Regarding my projects, I'm specially proud of the video game triad my teammates and I pulled off during college: [Andro Dunos](https://github.com/ch0m5/Project_1), [Order 227: Not a Step Back](https://github.com/ChillChiliStudio/Order227), and [The Witcher: Ties of Destiny](https://github.com/Broken-Gem-Studio/The-Witcher-Ties-of-Destiny), as well as the 3D OpenGL Game Engine ["GATE"](https://github.com/DocDonkeys/GATE_Engine) that [DÃ­dac](https://github.com/DidacRomero) and I built together.

🎮 I'm a Technical Game Designer graduated in [Video Game Design and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/grau-videojocs-bcn/) at [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/) - [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en).

🎓 I've been working on professional game development for several years and I'm specially proud of the projects my teammates and I managed to accomplish during college, such as [Andro Dunos](https://github.com/ch0m5/Project_1), [Order 227: Not a Step Back](https://github.com/ChillChiliStudio/Order227), and [The Witcher: Ties of Destiny](https://github.com/Broken-Gem-Studio/The-Witcher-Ties-of-Destiny), as well as the 3D OpenGL Game Engine ["GATE"](https://github.com/DocDonkeys/GATE_Engine) that [Dídac](https://github.com/DidacRomero) and I built together.
